          Afrique en Cirque is a show by Yamoussa Bangoura, inspired by daily
          life in Guinea. This performance shares the beauty, youth and artistry
          of African culture. A colorful show beyond its scenery, costumes and
          staging, it makes any theater vibrate with energy and represents the
          strength, agility and life’s joys of young Africans.

          Miigis: Underwater Panther is inspired by the formidable odyssey of
          the Anishinaabe along the water routes from the Atlantic shores to the
          Great Lakes, moving from salt to fresh water. Along this journey we
          discover the catalyst for this movement and encounter Indigenous
          archetypes, mystery beings, and the ancestral pull of the next seven
          generations.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this landmark production, we bring a significant cultural story to
          the surface, centering our narrative, and opening the imaginations of
          audiences. We share Anishinaabe story, archetypes, and ethos which are
          part of the Indigenous canon of North America, but whose stories have
          rarely - if ever - been seen or heard on stages.
        </p>

        <p>
          Miigis reveals the power of nature through dance, theatrical
          innovation, and a fusion of athleticism, music, and film.

          Okaidja continue to break new ground with a release of his latest
          classical African music album, titled – Jaku Mumor (Jàkú Mũmɔ – which
          means Ancestral Spirit in the Gãdangmé language) – inspired by ancient
          African wisdom. The new album dives deeper into Okaidja’s cultural
          roots by collaborating directly with the Gãdangmé Fishermen to share
          the full artistry of their a cappella singing and chants that awakes
          the spirit of the human soul.

          Dance Theater in 2015. The creation of Open Door was supported by
          commissioning funds from New York City Center. Generous support was
          provided by The Jaharis Family Foundation, Tracy Elise Poole, and The

          Endowment Fund.

          The Forgotten Kingdom renders an interwar letter from a mother to her
          daughter, in the form of a book of memory so that — years later, once
          grown — the daughter would remember how it felt to live in her
          parents’ vibrant, multiethnic Mediterranean world, before its
          unraveling. As the people, places and events that made a home come
          vividly alive, the daughter — and audiences with her — plunges into
          the days before wars splintered the Ottoman Empire into ethnic
          nation-states.
        </p>

        <p>
          The multimedia tale is woven with dreamlike theatrically projected
          sand animation, narration blending memoir and poetry, and a riveting
          musical score reframing Ottoman Jewish women’s song.
        </p>

        <p>
          Breathtaking sand images are created, morphed, and obliterated to form
          intensely emotional chronicles. The cinematographic score draws on the
          bittersweet rawness of Tango, the rhythmic fire of Arabic percussion,
          and gorgeous vocal harmonies layered on Western classical music’s
          harmonic roots. Sand and music intertwine with a “masterfully narrated
          tale” (Welland Port Coburn Concert Association), bound together with
          an evocative lighting and scenic design.

          Silenced as an apostle, framed as a prostitute, portrayed as the wife,
          mythologized as a hermit and tantric priestess, exalted as Goddess,
          Mary Magdalene has always been controversial and dangerous to the
          status quo. I am the utterance of my name: Divining Mary Magdalene is
          a music-theater piece untangling and illuminating the many surrounding
          beliefs, myths, contradictions, iconography, and decrees, in search of
          Magdalene and the meaning of her radical Gospel.
        </p>

        <p>
          Drawing from ancient texts, artworks, contemporary scholarship, and
          representations in contemporary culture, Sylvia Milo’s portrayal
          creates a prismatic image of Mary Magdalene in seven apparitions.
          Nathan Davis performs the rich musical score live onstage using
          instruments both ancient and modern – hammered dulcimer, harmonium,
          and hand drums – interweaving the sound design with field recordings
          from sites significant to the myths. A radiant video projection design
          and choreography expand the space — and our understanding of this
          essential story.
